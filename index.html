<p>This is my PM566 Final Project website.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The dataset, called <em>Infectious Diseases by Disease, County, Year,
and Sex</em>, is downloaded from <a
href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/">California Health and Human Services
Open Data Portal</a>.</p>
<p>This dataset contains case counts and rates by disease, county, year,
and sex for selected infectious diseases that met the surveillance case
definition in California. There are 9 columns in the dataset:
<em>Disease</em>, <em>County</em>, <em>Year</em>, <em>Sex</em>,
<em>Cases</em>, <em>Population</em>, <em>Rate</em>,
<em>Lower_95__CI</em>, and <em>Upper_95__CI</em>. There are 167,974
rows. The data represent cases with an estimated illness onset date from
2001 through the last year indicated from California Confidential
Morbidity Reports and/or Laboratory Reports. Data captured represent
reportable case counts as of the date indicated in the “Temporal
Coverage” section below, so the data presented may differ from previous
publications due to delays inherent to case reporting, laboratory
reporting, and epidemiologic investigation.</p>
<p>After looking at the whole dataset, we formed two questions: We would
like to know the infectious diseases with the highest prevalence, and in
which year the diseases had a highest infection rate. In that year, did
the diseases spread evenly across the whole state? Is there a
significant difference in infection rates between males and females?</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<div id="data-acquisition" class="section level2">
<h2>Data acquisition</h2>
<p>Infectious-disease dataset was downloaded from “<a
href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/infectious-disease"
class="uri">https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/infectious-disease</a>”.</p>
<p>Geographical dataset was downloaded from “<a
href="https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-county-boundaries/export/?disjunctive.statefp&amp;disjunctive.countyfp&amp;disjunctive.name&amp;disjunctive.namelsad&amp;disjunctive.stusab&amp;disjunctive.state_name&amp;refine.stusab=CA"
class="uri">https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-county-boundaries/export/?disjunctive.statefp&amp;disjunctive.countyfp&amp;disjunctive.name&amp;disjunctive.namelsad&amp;disjunctive.stusab&amp;disjunctive.state_name&amp;refine.stusab=CA</a>”.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-wrangling" class="section level2">
<h2>Data cleaning and wrangling</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Merge <em>Infectious-disease dataset</em> and <em>Geographical
dataset</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The dataset has 6 columns. Among them, columns “Cases” and “Rate”
have several missing values because of “Scoring Criteria” prevent them
from being publicated. Thus, we can remove them.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove NA rows.</p></li>
<li><p>The data type of column “Rate” is <em>chr</em>, which we do not
want it to be. Thus, we change the data type to <em>num</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The “County” column includes rows called “California”, which is
the state not a county, so we delete them. We saved the aggregate
“California” data into a new variable “Cal”.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="libraries-used" class="section level2">
<h2>Libraries used</h2>
<p>We used several R libraries: <em>data.table</em>, <em>tidyverse</em>,
<em>dplyr</em>, <em>plotly</em>, <em>DT</em>, <em>knitr</em></p>

<h1>Conclusion and Summary</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can see that <em>Campylobacteriosis</em>, <em>Salmonellosis</em>,
<em>Giardiasis</em>, <em>Shigellosis</em>, and
<em>Coccidioidomycosis</em> always have a higher infection rate from
2001 to 2020 than other infectious diseases. <em>Shiga toxin-producing
E. coli (STEC) without HUS</em> infection rate has increased
significantly a lot since 2011 (Figure 1).</li>
<li><em>San Benito</em> had a very high infection rate of
<em>Campylobacteriosis</em> in 2019 (Figure 2, 3), which is more than
60%.</li>
<li>There is not a significant difference between male and female for
the infection rate of Campylobacteriosis in San Benito in 2019 (p =
0.9867, Table 1).</li>
<li>Counties around San Francisco had a higher infection rate of
Campylobacteriosis in 2019. Inland area had relatively lower infection
rate of Campylobacteriosis (Figure 4).</li>
